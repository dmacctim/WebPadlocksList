# WebPadlocksList

The purpose of WebPadlocksList is to demonstrate understanding of JPA, servlets, and JSPs for my Java II course. It maintains a database of Padlock entities and Lockpicker entities, allowing lists of padlocks owned by each lockpicker to be maintained using servlets and jsp files. I collect padlocks and enjoy the hobby of lockpicking. The #1 lockpicker's rule is to never pick a lock in use (barring the circumstance that you may be asked by someone who you are certain owns that lock and what it goes to).
